# AI Agent SDK

We're building an AI agent for wellness intakes and bookings. Development is iterative, so we prefer **cheap or free** models to keep costs down.

**Production** will use official OpenAI models and their AI infrastructure. **Development** uses models via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai).
